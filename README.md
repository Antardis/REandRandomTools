# REandRandomTools
# This is a very small and personal repository designed to display my work rather than for use as a public tool. 
# Codes here can be converted for public use although this isn't recommended because they are tailored to very specific applications.
# 1) SolarDataAggregator - For aggregating data sets from SMA inverters. Processes a specified number of years.
# 2) SolarStatisticalAnalysis - After data set is cleaned, analyzed, and aggregated, statistical analysis is performed.
# 3) vegoplaces - Casual non professional code. From a list of vegetarian restaurants (I'm not a vegetarian), geo coding and Google API are used together to plot all locations.
